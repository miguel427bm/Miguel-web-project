                I've been listening to a bunch of music lately — Tyler, the Creator, The Marías, Mac DeMarco — and the
                list could go on. At the time I created this audio, I was missing a friend, which opened the door to
                thinking about other friends I haven’t talked to in a while. Not because we stopped being friends, but
                because life took us in different directions — and COVID had a major impact too. One moment I was in
                high school, worrying about dumb stuff, and then boom — COVID happened — and now I’m in college.
