                While having a star move around screen. For this project, I was listening to Marvin Gaye, and one of his
                lyrics stood out to me. It inspired the idea to create a visual animation using his quote. I decided to
                have the text slowly fade in on screen to give it an emotional, reflective feel. At the same time, I
                animated a star to move around the screen, bouncing from corner to corner—similar to the classic DVD
                logo effect—to create a sense of motion and energy behind the calmness of the quote.
