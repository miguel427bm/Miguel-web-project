                <strong>Title:</strong> Speedster<br />
                <strong>Semester/Year:</strong> Spring 25<br />
                <strong>Software:</strong> Photoshop<br /><br />

                For my raster image project, I used a photo of a New York City Street as the background and added four
                images: Batman, Spider-Man, a cyclist, and myself on my bike. I found an AI-generated image of Batman
                online and removed the background using the Select tool, which made it pretty easy to outline and
                isolate him. After adjusting the size, I placed him on top of a building to create a dramatic effect. I
                added Spider-Man to balance the scene between Marvel and DC, and it made sense to have him swinging
                upside down. Removing his background was more challenging—I had to use a different tool to be more
                precise. Then I added an image of myself riding my bike in the foreground, along with another cyclist
                behind me. The car lights in the background give the impression that we’re zooming through the city.

                <strong>Title:</strong> Geometric Me<br />
                <strong>Semester/Year:</strong>Spring 25<br />
                <strong>Software:</strong> Adobe illustrator<br /><br />

                This project took me some time to complete, but I really wanted to explore this style of art. I chose to
                create a self-portrait using geometric shapes because I’ve always been interested in that form of art.
                At first, it was a rocky start—I had to re-learn some of the Illustrator tools and keyboard shortcuts.
                One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to arrange the shapes without leaving gaps. I
                initially tried not to overlap them, but once I added a layer of color, I realized there were noticeable
                gaps between shapes. I ended up restarting the project, but I was able to reuse some parts of my first
                attempt and build on them by adding more shapes and overlapping where needed.
